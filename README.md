Aim was to test an idea to design an Operating system for any device without icons. Design was meant to be:
1. an easy UI to work with
2. work on any device
3. clear
4. straigt to point
5. a UI with similar design on every screen opened.
Most objectives of this project were achieved however there is lots of room for improvement.

1. Automatic sort capability for saving files e.g when a document is saved, downloaded, extracted, etc it goes to the documents folder.
2. When a function is switched on outline & text becomes white.
3. Dark theme only
4. Show charger/battery % when hover over power button.
5. Many changes expected because idea still incomplete. Might be handed over to an expert to get completed. This is only a mock design.
